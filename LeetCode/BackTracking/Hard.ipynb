    "On a 2-dimensional grid, there are 4 types of squares:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 represents the starting square.  There is exactly one starting square.\n",
    "- 2 represents the ending square.  There is exactly one ending square.\n",
    "- 0 represents empty squares we can walk over.\n",
    "- -1 represents obstacles that we cannot walk over.\n",
    "Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that **walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once**.\n",

    "Example 1:\n",

    "Input: [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,-1]]\n",

    "Explanation: We have the following two paths: \n",
